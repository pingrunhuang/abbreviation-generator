# Reason
Have you ever wondered why Kubernetes is called `k8s`? What `i18n` stands for? Well at least I have. Therefore, inspired by (this post)[https://medium.com/@rothgar/why-kubernetes-is-abbreviated-k8s-905289405a3c], I figured out I can write my own script to generate my own cool name!

# Result
```
kubernetes
Start to abbreviate:kubernetes
Result:k8s
```
